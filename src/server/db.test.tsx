```typescript
import { describe, expect, test } from 'vitest';
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

// This import will initially fail if src/server/db.ts does not exist
// or does not export a 'prisma' instance, satisfying the "fail initially" requirement.
import { prisma } from './db';

describe('Database Client Initialization', () => {
  test('should export a PrismaClient instance', () => {
    expect(prisma).toBeDefined();
    expect(prisma).toBeInstanceOf(PrismaClient);
  });

  // Additional tests could include checks for singleton pattern or connection status
  // once the implementation is in place, but for an initial failing test,
  // verifying the instance type is sufficient.
});
