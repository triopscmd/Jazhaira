```typescript
import { screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';

describe('Initial Project Setup & Configuration', () => {
  it('should ensure the main application root element is present', () => {
    // This test verifies that the fundamental HTML structure for a React application
    // is present in the DOM. In a typical React setup, this involves a root element
    // (e.g., <div id="root">) where the application component will be mounted.
    //
    // By default, Vitest's JSDOM environment starts with an empty document.
    // For this test to pass in a real scenario, the content of 'index.html' (or
    // at least the expected root element) would need to be loaded into the JSDOM.
    // Since the project is in its initial setup phase and 'index.html' is not
    // explicitly loaded into the testing environment's DOM, this test will
    // correctly fail initially because the element will not be found.
    //
    // Once the actual 'index.html' file is configured with the root element
    // and potentially loaded into the test environment (e.g., via a global setup
    // or by manually setting innerHTML for the document body), this test will pass.

    const appRootElement = screen.getByTestId('app-root');

    expect(appRootElement).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
